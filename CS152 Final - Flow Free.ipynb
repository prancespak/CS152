    "# Flow Free Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow Free is a iOS and Android puzzle game that resembles another game called Numberlink. Each puzzle has a grid with colored dots in some spaces of the grid. The objective of the game is to connect dots of the same color by drawing 'pipes' between them. Every square on the grid should be occupied by a color or a pipe, and no pipes can intersect each other. The difficulty increases as the dimensions of the grid increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Flow Free Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "This solver uses an A-star search algorithm in order to find the path to the goal node, which is the solved Flow Free puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PuzzleNode class\n",
    "The PuzzleNode class points to the parent node, the current state, the f-cost (which is the combination of the g-cost and the heuristic costs), the g-cost, and indicates whether the node has been pruned or not. \\medskip\n",
    "\n",
    "\\no indent The state is represented by a list of lists. For each color, there is a beginning, represented by a capital letter, and an end point, represented by the letter and '_end' attached to it. \\medskip\n",
    "\n",
    "\\noindent Within the class, there is a function that selects the color whose two ends are closest to each other to move. This is because it is generally a good strategy to connect the nodes closest together first, because the path is very straightforward and there are likely not many variations of how they would be connected. Considering this is important since every time a color is connected, the moves that can be taken are constrainedâ€”if a move early on turns out to be incorrect, much time might have been wasted on expanding an incorrect node.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Heuristic: Manhattan\n",
    "The first heuristic used is the Manhattan distance, which essentially shows how many steps away a color's tail is from its end. This heuristic adds up all of the distances for every color.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Heuristic: Misplaced Squares\n",
    "This heuristic compares the current state and the goal state and counts the number of squares that are incorrectly filled in. (Lower case and upper case versions of the same letter are assumed to be the same value.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Heuristic: Trapped Colors\n",
    "This heuristic looks at the number of trapped colors there are on the board. A trapped color is one that is surrounded by other colors/walls on all four sides. When this happens, the color cannot move and thus is a state in which the solution cannot be derived.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solver\n",
    "The solver implements A-star search to get to the correct solution. In the actual Flow Free game, the pipe is essentially a trail and only extends from the current end point of the trail. To represent this, every time a color is extended a square, the extended square is the color's capital letter, and the previous square becomes the color's lower case letter. Thus, in each expansion of a node, the solver is looking to extend the trail so that the capital letter is next to its end counterpart. (An example trail: a,a,a,a,A,A_end.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\\noindent It takes as input:\n",
    "- n - the dimension of the puzzle\n",
    "- state - the starting board state\n",
    "- cur_heur - the heuristic(s) that will be used\n",
    "- goal - the goal state (manually defined)\n",
    "- colors - a list of the colors in the game\n",
    "\n",
    "\\noindent The function outputs:\n",
    "- the board dimension\n",
    "- the frontier size\n",
    "- the number of steps taken to get to the goal state\n"

    "# Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Results\n",
    "The solver was run with three puzzles of varying dimensions (5x5, 6x6, 7x7). Each puzzle was run with each of the three heuristic functions. The tests (below) show that the misplaced heuristic performed far better than all the others and significatnly reduced the number of steps taken. The worst performing heuristic was the trapped heuristic. This is likely due to the fact that it is not really useful for reducing the explored states, particularly in the beginning, when there are not many squares filled in to begin with. It assesses all states as essentially the same unless there is a blocked node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of extremely long running time, the manhattan and trapped heuristics were not tested with larger boards. The misplaced heuristic performed well with even the larger 8x8 and 9x9 boards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All test puzzles are replications of actual levels in Flow Free. Flow Free has puzzles from dimensions of 5 to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible Improvements\n",
    "### Improvements in Performance\n",
    "Some of the heuristics did not perform well. Improvements could be made to the heuristics to run more efficiently. Alternatively, different heuristics could be made to better guide the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another improvement to performance could be to have a different criteria in selecting a color to extend. Currently, it chooses the color whose trail and end point are closest together. An alternative could be to choose the most constrained trail/point to extend. This might be an improvement because a constrained point (i.e. is surrounded on three sides) can only go in one direction anyways, so it is likely to be a correct move.\n",
    "### Improvements in experience\n",
    "An improvement to the overall experience of using this solver would be to create a way so that the goal state does not have to be manually inputted each time. It somewhat defeats the purpose of using the algorithm, since it requires the answer is already known. Instead of inputting the goal manually, the algorithm can check each state to see if it satisfies all the requirements of a goal state (i.e. there is one start and one end for all color trails, no empty squares, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another improvement would be to implement a class for the pipe/trail. Right now, the board has to be represented by a separate character for the trail, the end of the trail, and the end point that needs to connect to the trail. By making a class, the start and ends could be more easily accessed and the board could be represented in a more simple way."
